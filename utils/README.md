### **üìÑ Documentation: `llm_handler.py` - LLM Query Handler**

#### **Purpose**
The **`llm_handler.py`** file is responsible for querying a large language model (LLM) to generate structured and concise responses based on user input. It leverages the `langchain_groq` library to interact with the Groq-based LLM. The file ensures a structured querying process, proper logging of events, and error handling in case the LLM query fails.

---

#### **Main Features**
1. **Integration with Langchain Groq LLM**: The file utilizes the Groq API for large language model (LLM) processing to generate AI-powered responses based on user queries.
2. **Logging Configuration**: The file includes logging for debugging and tracking the process flow during the querying and response generation stages.
3. **Structured Querying**: The query is structured with specific instructions and guidelines to ensure the LLM provides concise, informative, and engaging responses using structured bullet points, emojis, and key facts.
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented to catch issues during the query generation, ensuring that users are informed in case of failures.

#### **Detailed Breakdown**

##### 1. **Logging Configuration**:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
```
- The logging module is configured to log messages with the `INFO` level or higher (e.g., WARNING, ERROR).
- The log messages include the timestamp, log level, and the message content, making it easy to track the operations and debug potential issues.

##### 2. **Function: `query_llm(query, retrieved_chunks, model_name)`**:
This function queries the large language model (LLM) to generate a structured response based on the user input and the retrieved document chunks.

**Arguments**:
- **`query` (str)**: The user's question or input that needs to be processed by the LLM.
- **`retrieved_chunks` (list)**: A list of document chunks that contain relevant information to help the LLM generate a response. These chunks are typically extracted from a document or set of sources related to the query.
- **`model_name` (str)**: The name of the LLM model being used (e.g., "groq" for Groq-based models).

**Returns**:
- **`str`**: A structured response generated by the LLM based on the user query and the retrieved context.

**Steps**:
1. **Logging the Query**:
   - The function logs the beginning of the LLM query, including the model name being used, to track the process.

2. **LLM Setup**:
   ```python
   llm = ChatGroq(
       temperature=0,
       groq_api_key=GROQ_API_KEY,
       model_name=model_name
   )
   ```
   - An instance of the `ChatGroq` class is created with the following parameters:
     - **`temperature=0`**: Controls the randomness of the response. A temperature of 0 ensures deterministic outputs, meaning the response will be more focused and consistent.
     - **`groq_api_key=GROQ_API_KEY`**: The API key for accessing Groq services, securely loaded from the environment variables.
     - **`model_name=model_name`**: The selected LLM model name, passed as an argument to the function.

3. **Context Text Construction**:
   ```python
   context_text = "\n".join(retrieved_chunks)
   ```
   - The retrieved document chunks are concatenated into a single string (`context_text`) using line breaks to form a comprehensive context that the LLM can refer to when generating the response.

4. **Prompt Construction**:
   ```python
   prompt = f"""
   üéØ You are an **AI expert** providing **concise, well-structured, and engaging** responses.

   üîç **User Query:** {query}

   üîé **Extracted Information from Trusted Sources:** 
   {context_text}

   ‚ú® **Response Guidelines:**  
   - Use **structured bullet points** ‚úÖ  
   - Highlight **key facts** with **emojis** üéØ  
   - Keep it **concise yet highly informative** üìå  
   - **No unnecessary filler text**‚Äîfocus on **value-driven insights** üöÄ  
   - Maintain a **professional yet engaging** tone üé§  
   - End with a **brief but powerful conclusion** ‚úçÔ∏è  

   Now, generate the structured response using **emojis** to enhance clarity and engagement.  
   """
   ```
   - A detailed prompt is constructed to instruct the LLM on how to generate the response. The prompt includes:
     - **User Query**: The original user input.
     - **Extracted Information**: The document chunks that contain relevant context for generating the response.
     - **Response Guidelines**: Specific instructions on how to format the response, including the use of emojis, bullet points, and a professional tone.
   
   This structured prompt helps guide the LLM to produce the desired format and style for the response.

5. **Generating the Response**:
   ```python
   response = llm.invoke(prompt)
   logging.info("‚úÖ LLM Response Generated Successfully.")
   return response
   ```
   - The LLM is queried using the constructed prompt by calling `llm.invoke(prompt)`. This sends the request to the Groq model for processing.
   - Upon successful completion, a success message is logged, and the response is returned.

##### 3. **Error Handling**:
```python
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"‚ùå LLM Query Error: {str(e)}")
    return "‚ùå Error generating LLM response."
```
- If any errors occur during the query process (e.g., network issues, invalid API key, etc.), the error is caught by the `except` block.
- An error message is logged, including the exception details, to help debug the issue.
- A generic error message, "‚ùå Error generating LLM response," is returned to the user in case of failure.

#### **Best Practices**
1. **Structured Responses**: The prompt is carefully structured with specific instructions for the LLM to follow. This ensures that the AI provides the most relevant and concise information in an engaging and readable format.
2. **Logging**: The use of logging at critical points in the function (e.g., when querying the LLM and upon successful response generation) helps track the flow of the process and identify any issues quickly.
3. **Error Handling**: The error handling mechanism ensures that the system is robust and can gracefully handle any unexpected failures, providing the user with appropriate feedback.

#### **Conclusion**
The **`llm_handler.py`** file handles querying a large language model (LLM) to generate structured, concise, and engaging responses based on user queries and retrieved document chunks. By leveraging the `langchain_groq` library, the file integrates Groq-based LLMs for AI-powered responses, with proper logging and error handling for smooth operation. The function `query_llm` ensures that the LLM responds in a well-structured and user-friendly format while following defined response guidelines.
