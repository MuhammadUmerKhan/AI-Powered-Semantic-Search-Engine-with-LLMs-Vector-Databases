## ðŸ“„ **`custom_urls.py` - Custom URL Search Handler**

### **Purpose**
The **`custom_urls.py`** module is responsible for handling user queries related to custom URLs. It provides the functionality to process user-defined URLs and fetch data from those URLs if they are added manually, rather than relying solely on Google Search API or pre-configured search engines.

### **Key Features**
- **Custom URL Query Processing**: This module listens for user input containing URLs or queries about specific websites and handles them accordingly.
- **URL Validation**: Validates if the input is a proper URL format before attempting to scrape or fetch data.
- **Article Scraping**: If a valid URL is entered, it can extract the content from that URL using the scraping functionality.

### **Workflow**
1. **User Input**: The user can enter a URL directly into the search bar or choose an option to provide custom URLs for search.
2. **Validation**: The system first checks if the input is a valid URL. If it's not, it prompts the user to enter a valid URL.
3. **Scraping**: Upon receiving a valid URL, the module fetches the content by calling the scraping function from the `scraper.py` module.
4. **Display Results**: After extracting the content, the results are displayed in the Streamlit UI, allowing users to read the extracted text directly or use it to refine their query further.

### **Core Functions**
- **`process_custom_url`**: Accepts the user-provided URL, validates it, and then extracts the necessary information from the page.
- **`fetch_article_from_url`**: Scrapes the content of the URL and returns it for further processing.

## ðŸ“„ **`search_engine.py` - Search Engine Implementation**

### **Purpose**
The **`search_engine.py`** module is the core of the AI-powered search engine. It handles the entire search flow, including fetching search results from Google Search API, scraping content, processing it, storing embeddings in the FAISS vector database, and generating AI-powered responses via the LangChain LLM.

### **Key Features**
- **Google Search Integration**: Fetches top search results from Google Search API.
- **Web Scraping**: Scrapes full articles from the URLs obtained from the search results.
- **Vector Storage**: Stores the embeddings of extracted content in the FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.
- **AI-Powered Answer Generation**: Uses LLMs (such as Llama or Grok) to generate structured, AI-powered responses based on the retrieved content.
- **Structured Display of Results**: Displays the AI-generated answers, along with source links, in a structured format.

### **Workflow**
1. **Query Input**: The user enters a search query on the UI.
2. **Fetching Results**: The search engine fetches the results via the Google Custom Search API.
3. **Scraping and Content Extraction**: It scrapes full-text content from the relevant URLs obtained from the search results.
4. **Embedding Storage**: The content is split into chunks, embeddings are generated, and stored in the FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.
5. **AI Response Generation**: The user query and relevant content chunks are fed to the LLM for generating a response.
6. **Displaying Results**: The results, including AI-generated answers and source links, are displayed on the UI.

### **Core Functions**
